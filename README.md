# CompGeo-Rust
A computational geometry library written in Rust. Currently a work in progress. See src/lib.rs for tests that show some usage examples. 

## Current Features 
**Points:** 
-  Distance calculations
-  Point orientation 
-  Convex hull
-  Closest pair that returns the points and the distance between them
	
**Lines:** 
-  Distance calculations
-  Line intersections
-  Parallel checks
-  Support for both line segments and infinite lines

**Circles:** 
-  Check if points or circles lie within a circle
-  Distance calculations
-  Arc length from 2 points or angle (in radians)

**Polygon:** 
-  Area function for all convex polygons.
-  Points can be given in clockwise or counter-clockwise order
